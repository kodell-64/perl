### Adventure Game, Korey O'Dell.

### Design

This is an example of OOP-Perl I did to demonstrate inheritance and multiple-inheritance with Perl, in a fun container. All code and HTML is written in a way to easily demonstrate how the components fit together.

No MVC or templating web models, here.

It uses the *Storable* CPAN module for simple data persistence to disk.

Very light example of OOP-Perl and storable (file-based) data.

### Setup

Runs under Apache 2.x with mod_fast_cgi.
