### A small subset of Perl projects I have authored

### Perl-OOP

Both the *automated_test_framework* and the storable_adventure_game exhibit object-oriented packages with multiple inheritance. The former contains lots of "working" code i.e. it's messy. The test framework was a heavy-duty component for many years in a now acquired successful VC startup.

The *storable_adventure_game* code is a light example of a OOP web app and using Storable, file-based persistence for a datastore. Written to teach and highlight Perl's package-based OOP abilities. 

#### Perl for audio pattern recognition

I did some proof-of-concept, audio-pattern matching using FFT science and hashing of the generated fingerprints. 

More code examples to come.
